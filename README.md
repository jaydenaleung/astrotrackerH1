# Astrotracker H1
The Astrotracker H1 is a DIY star tracker camera mount for astrophotography, made to open access to astrophotography without needing to purchase a more expensive star tracker. Includes a multi-axis rotational gimbal, automatic North Pole alignment, and possible upcoming GoTo integration.

# How It Works
Since astrophotography is done in very dark environments, a long exposure ranging from a second to the whole night is needed. Due to Earth's rotation, keeping the camera in the same place for a long exposure causes the image to display star trails instead of clear, detailed stars. Star trackers fix this problem by moving the camera on an equatorial mount with the path of the stars, eliminating star trails. See this picture for a diagrammed explanation:

# The 'Why' Behind the Project
As an avid photographer and engineer myself, I have always wanted to get more involved with astrophotography. Unfortunately, living in a city didn't play out well for me because of the massive amount of light pollution around me, blocking my view of the stars. I knew I wanted to combine my passions, and the opportunity to do so came through Hack Club's Highway to Undercity program. They fund almost any project you propose to them through their You Ship We Ship (YSWS) initiative.

After conducting some research, I found out that a star tracker was one of the most necessary tools to take better pictures of the night sky. Unfortunately, they were all priced around $500 USD - a hefty investment. Building a star tracker would allow me to combine my passions and achieve a more cost-effective solution at the same time.

# The Three Parts
There are always three parts to an engineering project like this, at least for the Highway YSWS program. One is computer-aided design (CAD) modeling; for large projects, this often takes the most time, as it did with this project. Another is printed circuit board (PCB) design, which is the electrical component of the project. Finally, the brain of the build is programmed in the software part, where firmware is written onto a microcontroller that controls the hardware. See the pictures below for how I went about this!
